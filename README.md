#Deprecation Notice
This work was based on early Glimpse 2.0 releases that never became official releases.
Since then the Glimpse roadmap has changed and I have not evaluated this against those plans.

#Glimpse.Nancy
Uniting two of the best .NET open source projects around!  
Check out the issues board to get involved.

##Coming Soon!
Everything is in place and ready to go when Glimpse 2.0 ships.

## Soon? I can't wait that long!
Pre-built binaries, including the latest Glimpse.Core v2 dll are available from the CI - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/csainty/glimpse-nancy/build/artifacts
